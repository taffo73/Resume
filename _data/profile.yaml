  As an experienced Home Services professional, I specialize in diagnosing, repairing, and installing major household appliances while delivering high‑quality workmanship and an exceptional in‑home customer experience. I manage daily service routes, lead two‑person crews, and oversee parts ordering, returns, and inventory to minimize costs and prevent losses. Skilled in triage and complex device troubleshooting, I provide customers with clear explanations and alternative service solutions when needed. I maintain accurate, up‑to‑date work orders and consistently meet productivity, safety, and compliance standards. Known for effective de‑escalation and customer‑focused service, I drive strong satisfaction and loyalty. I also conduct regular vehicle inspections, support field operations reliability, and provide coaching, training insights, and performance feedback to promote continuous improvement.
